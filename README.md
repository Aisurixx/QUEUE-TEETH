# QUEUE TEETH

Queue Teeth is a mobile application developed as part of our 2nd-year project. The app is designed to help patients efficiently manage their dental appointments by scheduling visits, sending reminders, and tracking upcoming appointments. Our goal with this project was to create a simple yet effective solution that enhances patient convenience and improves dental care management. This project allowed us to apply our skills in mobile app development, user interface design, and problem-solving to create a practical and user-friendly tool.
